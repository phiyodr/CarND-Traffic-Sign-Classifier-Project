**Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set (see below for links to the project data set)
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report



## Rubric Points
### Here I will consider the [rubric points](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/481/view) individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.

### Writeup / README

### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32, 32, 3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the many signs exists in the training set.

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)


I experimented with many normalization schemes but `x / 255 * 0.8 + 0.1` worked out the best.



#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 5x5    	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 32x32x6 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling			| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x6 					|
|						|												|
| Convolution 5x5	    | 1x1 stride, valid padding						|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling			| 2x2 stride,  outputs 10x10x16 				|
|						|												|
| Flatten				|												|
|						|												|
| Fully connected		| 400 neurons									|
| Fully connected		| 120 neurons									|
| Fully connected		| 84 neurons									|
| Softmax				| 43 neurons  									|
|						|												|
|						|												|
 


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an Adam optimizer with batch size 128 and run it for 50 epochs. I set the learning rate to .001.

I experimented with dropout but discared it again (final model does not overfit a lot).

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 1.0
* validation set accuracy of 0.943 
* test set accuracy of 0.923

If an iterative approach was chosen:

I changed the Network to be suitable for color images. Iterativly I did following steps:

* Decreaded learning rate, add dropout, increased batch size. 

Finally I ended up with the original LeNet but with a different normalization for the input images.


### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are six German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][./signs/gew√§hren.jpeg] ![alt text][./signs/rechts.png] ![alt text][./signs/bauarbeiten.jpeg] 
![alt text][./signs/achtung.jpg] ![alt text][./signs/STOP.jpg] ![alt text][./signs/30kmh.jpg]

The most difficult sign should be the speed limit sign, since the digits are hard to read.

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

All predictions were correct.

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

Due to the fact that the model is really good (94% on valid set) and my web images are relativly easy (e.g. no dark conditions) the model returned a 100% certainty for each sign.

### (Optional) Visualizing the Neural Network (See Step 4 of the Ipython notebook for more details)
#### 1. Discuss the visual output of your trained network's feature maps. What characteristics did the neural network use to make classifications?
